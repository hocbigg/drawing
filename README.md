# Summary

The Drawing curriculum is a complete education in Drawing using online materials.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

Process. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order. For simplicity, we recommend working through courses in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
